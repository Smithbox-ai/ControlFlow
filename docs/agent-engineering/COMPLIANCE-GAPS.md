Compliance rate: 11/11 (100%) against 9-item checklist

## Recently Resolved Gaps

### Adversarial Plan Review (NEW)
- Added `Challenger-subagent.agent.md` as adversarial plan auditor.
- Schema: `schemas/challenger.plan-audit.schema.json`.
- Atlas state machine extended with conditional `PLAN_REVIEW` gate.
- Trigger policy: 3+ phases, confidence < 0.9, or high-risk/destructive scope.
- Max 2 Challenger→Prometheus revision rounds before user escalation.

### Prometheus Mermaid Visualization (NEW)
- Prometheus now requires Architecture Visualization section for 3+ phase plans.
- Allowed diagram types: `flowchart TD`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`.
- Schema extended with optional `diagrams` array in `schemas/prometheus.plan.schema.json`.

### Shared Clarification Contract (NEW)
- Created `schemas/clarification-request.schema.json` as canonical shared contract.
- 5 acting agent schemas now reference shared contract via `$ref`.
- Oracle and Scout intentionally excluded (no `NEEDS_INPUT` status in their enum).

### Atlas Retry Reliability (NEW)
- Added Retry Reliability Policy to `Atlas.agent.md`.
- Added Section 7 (Retry Reliability) to `docs/agent-engineering/RELIABILITY-GATES.md`.
- Covers: silent failure detection, retry budgets, per-wave throttling, exponential backoff signaling, escalation thresholds.

### Token Optimization — Shared Policies (NEW, 2026-04-01)
- Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with shared Continuity, Failure Classification, NOTES.md baseline, and governance doc index.
- Removed identical `### Continuity` section from all 11 agent files.
- Removed standard Failure Classification block from 6 execution/review agents (Code-Review, Sisyphus, DevOps, BrowserTester, Frontend-Engineer, DocWriter). Challenger retains a deviation note (no `transient`).
- Pruned misplaced Resources entries: PART-SPEC/RELIABILITY-GATES removed from Explorer, BrowserTester, DocWriter, Oracle; CLARIFICATION-POLICY removed from Explorer, BrowserTester, DocWriter, Oracle, Challenger, Code-Review, Sisyphus, DevOps, Frontend-Engineer; TOOL-ROUTING removed from Code-Review; MIGRATION-CORE-FIRST moved from Atlas to DevOps.
- Updated PART-SPEC.md Section 2 to state shared policy rule.
- Estimated savings: ~150–200 tokens per agent, ~1200–1600 tokens across a full 8-agent pipeline call.

### bishx Mechanism Adoption (FINAL STATE, 2026-04-01)
Four mechanisms from the bishx multi-agent planning system were evaluated. Two were adopted after structural analysis; two were rejected.

**Adopted (active in Atlas):**
1. **Executability Audit** — Challenger now simulates cold-start execution on the first 3 plan tasks. Encoded in `challenger.plan-audit.schema.json` as `executability_checklist`. Prompt addition: ~6 lines in Challenger. Gate: any task that fails executability → MAJOR finding minimum.
4. **Validated Blocking Findings** — Code-Review now classifies each CRITICAL/MAJOR issue as `confirmed`/`rejected`/`unvalidated` and emits `validated_blocking_issues`. Atlas blocks only on confirmed blockers. Encoded in `code-review.verdict.schema.json` as `validation_status` per issue and `validated_blocking_issues` array. Prompt addition: ~3 lines in Code-Review, ~2 lines in Atlas.

**Rejected (removed, 2026-04-01):**
2. **Ceiling Scores** — REJECTED for Atlas. In bishx, ceilings are cross-validated between 4-6 independent reviewer streams (Skeptic, TDD, Completeness reviewers each bound separate dimensions). Atlas has no equivalent multi-stream structure; a single Challenger agent cannot cross-validate its own dimension scores. Ceiling fields added prompt/schema complexity without a structural signal source. Removed from `challenger.plan-audit.schema.json` and Challenger prompt.
3. **Repeat-Finding Escalation** — REJECTED for Atlas. In bishx, escalation runs across up to 10 planning iterations. Atlas caps at 2 Challenger→Prometheus rounds, with existing retry budgets and escalation thresholds already covering stop conditions. Recurrence escalation duplicated existing controls more than it added net value. Removed from `atlas.gate-event.schema.json`, `atlas.delegation-protocol.schema.json`, Challenger findings schema, and Atlas prompt.

**Explicitly NOT Adopted (with rationale):**
- **Persistent hook/session architecture** — bishx uses shell hooks (`stop-hook.sh`, `discover-skills.sh`) for persistent state across sessions. Atlas runs in VS Code Copilot agent context which has no equivalent shell lifecycle hooks. NOTES.md policy covers the same need.
- **10-iteration revision loops** — bishx allows up to 10 planning iterations. Atlas caps at 2 Challenger→Prometheus rounds to prevent endless loops. Existing retry budgets and escalation thresholds provide sufficient loop-stop controls.
- **10 separate reviewer agents** — bishx splits planning review into 6 specialist agents (Skeptic, TDD, Completeness, Integration, Security, Performance) plus Critic and Dry-Run Simulator. Atlas consolidates this into Challenger (adversarial auditor) and Code-Review (post-implementation verifier). Fewer agents → less orchestration overhead and context fragmentation.
- **bd (beads) task tracker integration** — bishx uses a local CLI tool (`bd`) for task tracking. Atlas uses the VS Code `#todos` tool which is natively integrated.

### Phase 3a Completion (2026-04-01)

All 8 agents previously targeted for Phase 3a now meet the 9-item checklist:

- **Oracle**: Added PreFlect section (Archive), explicit `Approval gates: N/A` statement (Tools), External Tool Routing rules (Tools).
- **Scout**: Added PreFlect section (Archive), explicit `Approval gates: N/A` statement (Tools).
- **Code-Review**: Added PreFlect section (Archive), explicit `Approval gates: N/A` statement (Tools), Clarification role statement (Non-Negotiable Rules).
- **Sisyphus**: Added Human Approval Gates statement (Tools), External Tool Routing rules (Tools), Uncertainty Protocol → `NEEDS_INPUT` delegation (Non-Negotiable Rules).
- **Frontend-Engineer**: Added Human Approval Gates statement (Tools), External Tool Routing rules (Tools), Uncertainty Protocol → `NEEDS_INPUT` delegation (Non-Negotiable Rules).
- **DevOps**: Added full Approval Gates table (Prompt), External Tool Routing rules (Tools), Uncertainty Protocol → `NEEDS_INPUT` delegation (Non-Negotiable Rules).
- **DocWriter**: Added Human Approval Gates statement (Tools), External Tool Routing rules (Tools), Uncertainty Protocol → `NEEDS_INPUT` delegation (Non-Negotiable Rules).
- **BrowserTester**: Added Human Approval Gates statement (Tools), External Tool Routing rules (Tools), Uncertainty Protocol → `NEEDS_INPUT` delegation (Non-Negotiable Rules).

## Gap Details

No remaining gaps. All 11 agents are fully compliant with the 9-item P.A.R.T checklist as of 2026-04-01.
